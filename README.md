# covid-19-policies-effect-on-philly-policing
My team conducted a natural experiment to find the causal effect of COVID-19 Policy changes on arrests in Philadelphia. I was in charge of data analysis and visualization and I investigated the changes in arrets for petty crimes before an after the March 17 Interal Police Memo in comparison to arrests in previous years. My analysis suggests that the memo was responsible for a significant decrease in petty arrests, but unlike my team's hypothesis, the policy lift did not necessarily lead to over-compensation of arrests in the post-period.
